# Density-based Weighting for Imbalanced Regression

This repository contains code and data for the experiments of our paper ["Density-based weighting for imbalanced regression"](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10994-021-06023-5).

* `exp1_and_2`: contains the experiments with synthetic data and the comparison to SMOGN
* `exp3`: contains the experiment with statistical downscaling of precipitation based on DeepSD
* `smogn_with_denseweight`: contains the smogn library modified to allow using DenseWeight as a relevance function 

Our proposed method DenseWeight is also available [here](https://github.com/SteiMi/denseweight) as an easy-to-use Python package.
